# Liver_Tumour_Recognition_and_Classification_with_Model-agnostic_Interpretable_Explanations

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary code and resources to train a model using the `Main.ipynb` notebook. The generated images will be stored in the specified directory. Additionally, you can find pre-trained models and their weights located in this repository.

## Files

- `Main.ipynb`: Notebook to train the model.
- `Generated_Images.zip`: Zip file containing generated images.
- `Trained_Models.md`: Document with information and links to trained models and weights.

## Instructions

1. Use the `Main.ipynb` notebook to initiate the training process.
2. Once trained, the generated images will be located in the directory.
3. Pre-trained models and their weights can be found as described in the `Trained_Models.md` file.
